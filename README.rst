Robotics networking stuff.

To install, run:

    python2.7 setup.py install --user

This will make a user install. Make sure your environment sees executables in
the local path.

If you're developing, use the following command:

    python2.7 setup.py develop --user

Any changes you make will take effect immediately. No need to reinstall.
